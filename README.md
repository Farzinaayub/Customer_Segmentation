# Customer Segmenattion using Kmeans

This project utilizes K-means clustering to segment customers based on their behavior and attributes. Customer segmentation is a valuable strategy for businesses to tailor their marketing, services, and product offerings to different customer groups.

This Project utilizes an E-commerce database that lists purchases made by  âˆ¼ 4000 customers over a period of one year (from 2010/12/01 to 2011/12/09). Based on this analysis, I develop a model that allows to anticipate the purchases that will be made by a new customer, during the following year and this, from its first purchase.

In this project I have
- Utilized K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their attributes and behavior
- Extracted meaningful insights and patterns from the customer data
- Developed targeted marketing strategies based on the identified customer segments
